<i>The Ph&oelig;nix of Sodom</i>.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">think</span> it a duty I owe both the
reader and myself, to account for my acquaintance with any part
of the disgraceful transactions disclosed in the annexed
pages.</p>
<p>Some months ago, when I was contemplating the most odious
characters on the list of Attorneys, to compose the Fifth Number
of my Strictures on the Practice of those voracious vultures, it
came to my knowledge that an Attorney named Wooley (with that
alacrity with which crows fly to carrion) had repaired to the
different prisons, where those wretches apprehended in Vere
Street were committed, and, <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>under pretence of assisting the
offenders obtaining their liberty, and enabling them to escape
justice, stripped them of every guinea they possessed, and,
indeed, of every article that would produce one at a
pawnbroker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I therefore sent to Newgate, to learn
from Cook, the landlord of the house, whether my information was
correct; who sent his wife to me, and related a long history of
the means and fallacious pretences by which he obtained above
thirty pounds from her, for the purpose of <i>bringing her
husband through</i>; that being the phrase of those fellows, who
hang about prisons, to tutor their new clients:&mdash;(<i>I have
made use of the expression</i> <span
class="GutSmall">TUTOR</span>, <i>because there are degrees of
iniquity</i>, <i>that the most atrocious offenders accustomed to
a long residence in the cells of Newgate have yet to learn of a
certain description of attorneys</i>;) in fine, after he had
exhausted every stratagem that his colleague the devil and
himself could devise to get money, and finding no more could be
extracted from nakedness, he became wholly negligent of his <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>client; and in
order to get rid of Cook&rsquo;s importunities, told him he must
have fifty pounds more, or he could not get him liberated.&nbsp;
On the woman prostrating (as the truth was) that almost every
article of wearing apparel had been disposed of to raise the
money he already had received, he very friendly suggested to her,
that a woman of her appearance might easily raise money <i>by
putting off One Pound Bank Notes that he could procure for her at
Ten Shillings each</i>! the woman could answer only with a
groan&mdash;&ldquo;I am in trouble enough already!&rdquo; and
declined the mode he proposed, to procure liberty for her
husband, and a halter for herself!&mdash;Here the material part
of the negociation ended, and Cook was left by this virtuous one,
et cetera, without the least assistance at his trial, not even a
guinea for council, or the expence of a single sheet of
paper.&nbsp; In this dreadful situation, I call it a dreadful
situation, for whatever crimes a man be charged with, he is
certainly entitled to the benefit of a defence; especially when
he <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>paid so
amply for it: and though ultimately he was convicted, and
sentenced to the Pillory, I would ask, if, under all these
circumstances, his virtuous attorney ought not to have been
sentenced to a gibbet?&mdash;However, it does not appear to me,
that had Wooley done all that he was able, he could have saved
Cook from his fate; for affidavit men could be of no service:
however, as in my next Number of Strictures I have a very long
chapter to bestow on the sympathetic feelings, and matchless
integrity of this man, in an hundred other instances equally
enormous; I shall for the present drop the subject, having
afforded my readers a trifling shred, or splinter, of his great
stock of virtue.</p>
<p>It will be necessary here to correct a false opinion that is
gone abroad respecting the nature of Cook&rsquo;s
offence.&mdash;It is generally believed, that he was convicted of
Sodomy: but the fact is, that he was neither convicted, or even
indicted for that offence, but for keeping a house of resort, or
rendezvous for such detestable <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>wretches to meet at.&mdash;I have
thought it proper, nay just, to make this distinction, to lessen
in some measure the horror that the public in general have felt
against him.</p>
<p>My original inquiry into the conduct of Wooley was, merely to
punish him for his shameful conduct as an Attorney, by making an
application to the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench for restoration of
the money he robbed Cook of; and to shew the Court and public of
what pernicious materials some attorneys are
composed:&mdash;therefore, if Wooley thinks it any degradation to
be acquainted with Cook, he must remember, it was his own infamy
that brought it on; and I shall never be ashamed to advocate the
cause of the oppressed, or terrified at the task of reprobating
the oppressor.&nbsp; It has been observed by an elegant writer,
that &ldquo;the man who allows the oppression shares the
crime;&rdquo; and I certainly shall shew that Cook has endured a
scene of oppression that the laws of this country never did, and
I never will sanction, for the purpose of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>screening
opulent infamy; the crime of the man is no justification of the
brutality with which he was treated&mdash;a brutality repugnant
to the feelings of every man possessing the generous bravery of
Englishmen, who are ever merciful.&nbsp; Cowards only are cruel;
and the man who would put a rat to death by wanton torture is at
best but an eminent ruffian! but more upon this subject when I
have gone through the offensive part of my task, which is some
slender description of the enormities committed in various parts
of the town by these Sodomitical miscreants.</p>
<p>Cook and his wife, elate with the prospect of procuring
justice for the injury they had received from Wooley, considered
me their friend, and disclosed all the circumstances that follow;
and in answer to some inquiries that curiosity led me to make, I
received a long written history of iniquities (which I shall
partially relate) prefaced by the following paragraph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not plead any thing in extenuation of <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the offence for
which I have been convicted and punished; I confess I merited all
I met with; I own I participated in all the guilt except the
final completion of it, which is abhorrent to my nature.&nbsp; I
am, therefore, the more criminal, because I had no unnatural
inclinations to gratify:&mdash;I was prompt by <i>Avarice</i>
only, and not by the indulgence of vicious propensities;&mdash;if
I had, there would be witnesses enough against me, among the
detestable crew I am about to expose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cook, though an illiterate, man, possesses a strong mind, and
an accurate memory.&nbsp; He states, that he unfortunately met a
man named Yardley, at the King&rsquo;s Arms, Round Court, in the
Strand, who proposed taking a Public House, and making it a joint
concern: he, by degrees, opened to Cook his plan, and told him he
was acquainted with a great number of gentlemen, some hundreds,
who would frequent a house that he kept; and who were so generous
in payment, that he knew a man <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>who kept a house of the same kind,
who, in three years, got money enough to live upon and
retired.</p>
<p>This picture of advantage caught Cook;&mdash;and he closed
with the proposals, having about one hundred and fifty pounds in
his pocket; and, in conjunction with this man, took the Swan in
Vere-street, the fatal house in question; which was entered upon,
and furnished in a style most appropriate for the purposes it was
intended.&nbsp; Four beds were provided in one
room:&mdash;another was fitted up for a ladies&rsquo;
dressing-room, with a toilette, and every appendage of rouge,
&amp;c. &amp;c.:&mdash;a third room was called the Chaple, where
marriages took place, sometimes between <i>a female
grenadier</i>, six feet high, and a petit maitre not more than
half the altitude of his beloved wife!&nbsp; These marriages were
solemnized with all the mockery of <i>bride maids</i> and
<i>bride men</i>; and the nuptials were frequently consumated by
two, three, or four couple, in the same room, and in the sight of
each other! incredible as this circumstance <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>may appear,
the reader may depend it is all provable:&mdash;the upper part of
the house was appropriated to wretches who were constantly in
waiting for casual customers; who practised all the allurements
that are found in a brothel, by the more natural description of
prostitutes; and the only difference consisting in that want of
decency that subsists between the most profligate men and
depraved women.&mdash;Men of rank, and respectable situations in
life, might be seen wallowing either in or on the beds with
wretches of the lowest description: but the perpetration of the
abominable act, however offensive, was infinitely more tolerable
than the shocking conversation that accompanied the perpetration;
some of which, Cook has solemnly declared to me, was so odious,
that he could not either write, or verbally relate.&nbsp; It
seems many of these wretches are married; and frequently, when
they are together, make their wives, who they call
<i>Tommies</i>, topics of ridicule; and boast of having compelled
them to act parts <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>too shocking to think of;&mdash;an instance of which I
must relate, because the history of the country furnished a
precedent, that consigned a Peer of the realm, and his infamous
associate, to the gallows: I allude to Lord Audley&rsquo;s case,
who was convicted of rape and sodomy at one time with his own
wife.&mdash;The instance I shall relate was told at Vere-street
by the husband, to many of the wretches, and the partner of his
guilt, then present, who joined in the relation, as if it had
been a meritorious act:&mdash;this ill-fated woman had been
brought to that pitch of infamy, that she frequently endured it,
as if it was no offence even to modesty! the dreadful fellow, who
is the subject of the narration, is one of three miscreants
living together in the same public office in the city, one of
whom is known by the appellation of <i>Venus</i>.</p>
<p>It seems the greater part of these reptiles assume feigned
names, though not very appropriate to their calling in life: for
instance, Kitty Cambric is a Coal Merchant; Miss Selina, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>a Runner at a
Police office; Black-eyed Leonora, a Drummer; Pretty Harriet, a
Butcher; Lady Godina, a Waiter; the Duchess of Gloucester, a
gentleman&rsquo;s servant; Duchess of Devonshire, a Blacksmith;
and Miss Sweet Lips, a Country Grocer.&nbsp; It is a generally
received opinion, and a very natural one, that the prevalence of
this passion has for its object effeminate delicate beings only:
but this seems to be, by Cook&rsquo;s account, a mistaken,
notion; and the reverse is so palpable in many instances, that
the Fanny Murry, Lucy Cooper, and Kitty Fisher, are now
personified by an athletic <i>Bargeman</i>, an <i>Herculean
Coal-heaver</i>, and a deaf tyre Smith: the latter of these
monsters has two sons, both very handsome young men, whom he
boasts are full as depraved as himself.&nbsp; These are merely
part of the common stock belonging to the house; but the visitors
were more numerous, and, if possible, more infamous, because more
exalted in life: and <i>these ladies</i>, like the ladies of the
petticoat order, have their favorite men; one <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of whom was
White, a drummer of the guards, who, some short time since, was
executed for a crime of the most detestable description with
Hebden an Ensign.&nbsp; White, being an universal favorite, was
very deep in the secrets of the fashionable part of the coterie;
of which he made a most ample confession in writing, immediately
previous to his execution; the truth of which he averred, even to
his last moments; but it is impossible to give it literally, for
the person who took it, in the presence of a magistrate, said
that the recital made him so sick he could not proceed.</p>
<p>It seems that these odious practices are not confined to one,
two, or three houses, either public or private; for there are
many about town: one in the vicinity of the Strand; one in
Blackman-street in the Borough; one near the Obelisk, St.
George&rsquo;s-fields; one in the neighbourhood of
Bishopsgate-street, kept by a fellow known by the title of the
Countess of Camomile; perhaps the title was derived from his
ancient place of residence!&mdash;This <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>wretch was sent to the cold bath of
Newgate for two years, by way of quenching a flame that had been
raised by the charms of an uncomplying boy.&nbsp; The old
worn-out catamites are stationed in different lodgings, and
maintained, for the purpose of entrapping servants out of place,
and other distressed characters; and as distress is the most
potent enemy to virtue, they too frequently succeed in the
objects of their employers:&mdash;no expence is spared for
clothes, public places, or pocket money, till the ends are
obtained.&nbsp; Many of these breeches-clad bawds have chambers
in the different Inns of Court, the Temple not excepted, where
they carry on their practices with greater security from
detection; which is somewhat extraordinary, when we consider that
lawyers are not very partial to any description of monsters but
their own!</p>
<p>There is now a wretch in Newgate, under sentence of three
years, for this abominable crime, and that, too, for the third
time!&mdash;this lump of excremental filth (known among the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>gang by the
appellation of <i>Miss Fox</i>) has been a common hack ever since
he was twelve years old, and is now about seven and twenty: it is
said that he is at this hour the darling of a young man of rank,
who audaciously introduced him to his family as a fellow-student
at college; and, in one year, squandered seventeen hundred pounds
upon this miscreant.</p>
<p>It is a melancholy consideration that there is not some mode
of restraining this vice, either by castration, or some other
cogent preventative, without waiting for the completion of the
offence, which enacts the penalty of death:&mdash;the moment it
is discovered that the purposes of our creation are defeated, and
that nature revolts from the ordinances of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, existence is uselessly lavished upon a
being, more unworthy animation than a mandrake.&nbsp; To
eradicate this evil, should Divine Vengeance resist to another
fire, let the people of England devoutly pray, that the flames
may extend to the <i>Brimstonic part of Attornies</i>, whose
crimes cry equally loud for sulphurous purification.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>That
the reader may form some idea of the uncontrolable rage of this
dreadful passion, Cook states, that a person in a respectable
house in the city, frequently came to his sink of filth and
iniquity, and stayed several days and nights together; during
which time he generally amused himself with eight, ten, and
sometimes a dozen different boys and men!&mdash;There can be no
doubt of the truth of this assertion, for an explanation took
place before some of the parties connected with him in business,
when Cook sent to the house for a bill that the wretch owed
him.&nbsp; It is said that this animal is now in a mad-house;
which, in my apprehension, is the natural consequence of
transactions which can only be produced by a temporary
insanity.</p>
<p>In contemplating this calamitous vice, a charitable
disposition would lead us to believe that it is the effect of a
dreadful malignant malady, that assumes such an irresistible
dominion over the faculties, that neither religion, philosophy,
or the fear of death, can resist.&nbsp; <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Before I
could give credit to a twentieth part of the account transmitted
to me, I waited till Cook was discharged from his imprisonment,
and then interrogated him, with all the art and force of reason
that I was master of, as to the truth of his relation, more
especially the identity of the persons whose names he mentioned;
stating to him, that even an insinuation of so foul an imputation
against an innocent man, would inevitably consign him to an
infinitely worse punishment than that he had already suffered:
but his answers were such, as left me no excuse to doubt the
truth; and notwithstanding my full conviction upon the subject, I
have not ventured to fasten the odium upon any respectable
character, leaving a disclosure of that nature to be extorted
from the parties themselves in a Court of Justice:&mdash;nor
would I have sullied the idea of manhood with this history of
human depravity upon the bare assertion of any man, or any ten
men, who were within the possibility of being induced by some
purpose to fabricate such an abominable <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>story; but
the statement of Cook cannot be subject to any such
misrepresentation, for it is matter of record:&mdash;thirty of
the parties he describes to be the constant frequenters of the
house were apprehended by the Police officers, and that on a
Sunday evening; they were all examined by the Magistrates, and
their guilt established, though in different degrees: and the
dreadful shocking consequences of their conviction ended in the
execution of a sentence so disgraceful to humanity, so contrary
to the punishment awarded by the laws of England, that the
foulest page in the history of savage ferocity must blush at the
relation of that ruffianly scene of human degradation; a scene
that never could have disgraced the streets of London but in the
Sheriffalty of Mr. Matthew Wood; and never can happen again,
until Sheriffs and Pillories are made of the same materials.</p>
<p>Cook, under an idea that it would procure him a remission of
the pillory, was desirous of disclosing the names of a great
number of <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>persons involved in the transactions: and a meeting took
place, at the Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office, upon the
subject; but which produced no other effect, than an order to put
Cook in the Pillory the next day, which was accordingly done;
and, upon his return to Newgate, Suter, the head turnkey, said to
him, &ldquo;<i>Cook</i>, <i>it was not intended you should have
come back alive</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;There can be no doubt but that
the Turnkey&rsquo;s apprehensions were well founded.</p>
<p>It seems that Alderman Plomer, one of the Sheriffs who
succeeded Messrs. Atkins and Wood, heard of the attempt made at
the Secretary of States; and wishing to be satisfied of these
facts, went to Cook in Newgate several times, and had him into
the keeper&rsquo;s parlour, where he conversed with him on the
subject;&mdash;and on receiving a list of the names the Sheriff
assured him that he had no hope of any remission of his sentence
whatever, for he had offended persons too powerful to contend
with; but that at the expiration of his imprisonment he would
endeavour to do something for him; <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and befriend him;&mdash;but the
Sheriff died before Cook&rsquo;s time was out.&nbsp; Whatever my
own opinion may be respecting the situation in life of the
parties who opposed the remission of the sentence, or however
well founded that opinion may be, I do not think myself safe in
giving it publicity: I shall, therefore, only observe that it is
an illustration of the old trite saying, <i>the truth is not at
all times to be spoken</i>, nor indeed <i>in all places</i>!</p>
<p>Having stated sufficient to lay the foundation of an inquiry
in a Court of Justice into the truth of Cook&rsquo;s relation, I
shall in this place only ask a few questions of the parties
implicated; and that, too, without raising a pretence to prate
about libels: in doing which it may be sufficient only to enlarge
upon a sagacious and judicious remark of a worthy Magistrate,
viz. How came a man of fortune and fashion to such a
house?&mdash;I, therefore, shall repeat the question&mdash;What
possible business could a man of rank, or respectable merchant,
or clergyman, or any other man in the <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>character of a gentleman, have, or
what reasonable excuse can he make, for such frequent attendance
at a low, dirty public house, in the filthy avenues of Clare
Market&mdash;the common and exclusive resort of the persons I
have described: and that, too, on a Sunday, which was the
general, and grand day of rendezvous! and to render their excuse
the more entangled and doubtful, some of the parties came a great
distance, even so much as thirty miles, to join the festivity and
elegant amusements of grenadiers, footmen, waiters, drummers, and
all the Catamite brood, kneaded into human shape, <i>from the
sweepings of Sodom</i>, <i>with the spawn of Gomorrah</i>.</p>
<p>It may naturally be supposed that this vice is more expensive
than any other, and is the vortex that engulphs the property of
men, whose acquaintance are astonished at the mode of their
getting rid of their fortunes.&nbsp; I remember a man, who had a
place of great emolument, a considerable sum of ready money, and
thirty thousand pounds, the fortune of an <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>ill-fated
woman whom he married; all of which vanished, without a trace of
its destination;&mdash;he was reduced to the necessity of
continually raising small sums by the most unworthy means: but I
am now satisfied of the means by which he squandered away his
property.&mdash;I think he is dead, as I observe another
gentleman filling his situation; his memory and his crimes shall
never be disturbed by me: and there cannot be any doubt but that
many men under the same circumstances are brought to beggary by
similar pursuits.</p>
<p>The reader will recollect that I declared myself an advocate
for the oppressed of every description; a declaration I shall
elucidate in the close of these pages, and which will be found to
originate in Cook&rsquo;s anxiety to expose the parties
implicated in the atrocious scenes related: and it must be
lamented, that in this instance, as in all others where indigence
has to combat with wealth, this man has raised a host of powerful
enemies; for there is scarcely any description of men, but some
individual <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>is comprehended in the associates of this vice; even men
in the sacerdotal garb have descended from the pulpit to the
gully-hole of breathing infamy in Vere-street, and other places
for similar vice: but I must spare myself and my readers the
ungracious task of pursuing, in detail, circumstances that almost
chill the blood to think of, and afflict me with the same
sensation that a crimping knife on my side would create.&mdash;I
will therefore briefly consider the origin and progress of this
crime, which is so detestable, that the law of England blushes to
name it; and in all legal process, treats it as a crime not fit
to be named among Christians; a silence, which is also preserved
by the edict of Constantius, and others.&nbsp; Indeed, the
express law of <span class="smcap">God</span> dooms the offender
to death; and of the verity of this Divine declaration we have a
signal instance, long before the Jewish dispensation, by the
destruction of two cities by fire from heaven, so that this is a
universal, and not a provincial or local precept; and our ancient
laws seem implicitly to have followed <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>this divine decree, by commanding
such miscreants to be burnt to death; though Fleta says they
should be buried alive:&mdash;both these punishments were
inflicted by the ancient Goths.</p>
<p>Reading a foreign history, the locality of which I do not
remember, I found the description of another punishment, called
the <i>Embrace</i>;&mdash;which put an end to the
criminal&rsquo;s existence, by a machine constructed in the form
of a beautiful woman, and so contrived, that the miserable victim
was pressed to death by being folded in her arms.&nbsp; This
crime, however detestable, has certainly spread itself, and
tainted the whole face of the creation; and it is an erroneous
notion entertained by the people of this country, that it is
tolerated in Italy, and some parts of the continent; for the laws
against it are pretty general in every country, though, perhaps,
like ours, they relax in the necessary severity.</p>
<p>The Arabs, indeed, make very light of the offence, especially
when committed with a <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>beast; the Mahometans, also, are much
addicted to the crime, (at least by the testimony of some
travellers); yet I cannot see how that agrees with the account
they give of the Upas tree of Java, which they affirm sprung up
as a punishment for that sin; as appears by the following passage
in the new Alcoran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country round the tree was inhabited by people
strongly addicted to the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah; when the
great Prophet, Mahomet, determined not to suffer them to lead
such detestable lives any longer, he applied to <span
class="smcap">God</span> to punish them; whereupon <span
class="smcap">God</span> caused this tree to grow out of the
earth, which, destroyed them all, and rendered the country for
ever uninhabitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the best authority that can be gathered, this crime was
first introduced into England about the year 1315, by a sect of
heretics called Lollards; whose intent it was, among other most
damnable doctrines to subvert the Christian faith; for from a
note on the Parliamentary <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Rolls it is said, &ldquo;<i>A Lollard
has committed the sin not to be named among
Christians</i>,&rdquo; which seems to be the first authentic
account of it in England.&nbsp; Many years previous to the reign
of Geo. I. the sin was permitted without any exemplary
punishment:&mdash;but about the 12th year of that reign a number
of those wretches were apprehended, and convicted of the most
abominable practices, some of whom were put to death; which gave
a check to the evil for some time.</p>
<p>We will now come to the prevalency of the crime in the present
age.&nbsp; About five and twenty years ago, there existed a
society of the same order with the Vere-street gang, in the City
of Exeter, most of whom were men of rank and local situation;
they were apprehended, and about fifteen of them tried; and,
though they were acquitted by the letter of the law, the enraged
multitude was so convinced of their guilt; that without any
respect to their rank, they burnt them in effigy.</p>
<p>About the same period, another disgraceful <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>scene was
exhibited in London, at Clement&rsquo;s-lane, near the new Church
in the Strand; (the exhibition of that crew is in the memory of
many persons who may read these pages;) this scene was, if
possible, more ridiculously wicked; for though it embraced all
the turpitude of the Vere-street Coterie, yet the public
indignation was in some measure for a moment allayed, by the
grotesque appearance of the actors:&mdash;they were seized in the
very act of giving caudle to <i>their lying-in women</i>, and the
new-born infants personated by large dolls! and so well did they
perform the characters they assumed, that, one miscreant escaped
the vigilance of the officers and the examining magistrates, and
was discharged as a woman!</p>
<p>I cannot pass this description of <i>ladies</i>, without
making mention of another, usually entitled to an external
tribute due to delicacy; for it seems that one, of no
inconsiderable consequence to the dignity of the Coterie, is, by
profession, a Chimney Sweeper and Nightman, an employment not ill
appropriate to the delicate <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>passions which constitute his
amusement.&nbsp; This lump of diabolism resides west of Hyde-park
corner; and some time ago married a little Catamite, called Miss
Read, according to the rites of the Vere-street church; and, of
course, did that which all good husbands will do, took his
precious spouse to live in the house with him, the better to
secure himself from the effects of cuckoldom: but it so happened,
that this <i>sweet-scented enamorata</i> has a wife,
unfortunately for the poor woman recognized by the Canons of the
Church of England; and, therefore, to pave the way for this
little dung-hill, Venus, he was introduced as a young man who
wished to board and lodge in a decent family; and three guineas
per week was the stipulated price, which the poor deluded woman
thought an acquisition to her family, and worthy her attention;
little dreaming that this knight of the gully-hole regularly gave
<i>Miss Read</i> the money every week, in order that he might be
considered as an honorable and punctual pay master!&nbsp; This <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>miscreant is
said to be worth several thousand pounds!&mdash;Now reader, put
the money out of the question, and say what is he worth without
it?</p>
<p>I have before observed, this short Treatise is not meant for
anything like a detailed description of an hundredth part of the
vast geography of this moral-blasting evil; but the time is near
at hand that will afford a most ample display of this
wide-spreading contagion;&mdash;which, dreadful and poisonous as
the whole is to the ear of manhood, there is one feature more
excruciating to my feelings than all the rest; and that is, the
situation of women who are subject to all the indiscribable
tortures inflicted upon them, by an unfortunate, ill-fated
marriage with beings of this description, whose object in
marrying is wholly the property they possess:&mdash;that a fine,
elegant, perhaps beautiful woman, should be doomed to have her
bed encumbered with a wretch, who loathes her person, squanders
her fortune, and treats her with criminal contempt, to indulge <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>damnable
propensities, with (if I may be allowed the metaphor) the
<i>scavengers of Sodom</i>!&nbsp; And yet the laws of the country
afford her no redress, the abomination is no cause of divorce;
yet if, on her part, she should listen to the voice of nature,
and presume to convince the world that she feels the poignancy of
her misery, and flies to the arms of a man who knows how to
estimate her worth, the law, like a bull-dog, seizes on her
indiscretion, and she is deemed unworthy the association of the
virtuous part of sex! and doomed to pine out her life in the most
aggravated species of celibacy.&nbsp; I must beg leave to
illustrate this circumstance by an instance which occurred about
six years ago.</p>
<p>One of these horrid wretches got hold of a fine handsome boy,
whom he met with in the Park; and took him to various houses,
several times, for the most abominable purposes.&nbsp; The lad
had the curiosity to watch him home; and having called many times
without seeing him, the wife was induced to ask his business with
her husband? when this young student in the <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>cursed
science told her, not only what his business then was, but what
had already panned between them.&mdash;The woman, struck with
horror, grief, and amazement, retired to her room, and was a
corpse in an hour!</p>
<p>It has been observed by a learned Judge, that the proof of
this crime ought to be the more clear, as it is the more
detestable; that it ought to be strictly and impartially proved,
and then as strictly and impartially punished.&nbsp; It is an
offence, like that of rape, easily charged, but very difficult to
be disproved;&mdash;the accusation should, therefore, be clearly
and incontestibly made out; for if false, it deserves a
punishment inferior only to that of the crime itself: and Sir M.
Hale relates two very extraordinary cases of malicious
prosecutions for rape, that happened within his own observation,
and concludes thus; &ldquo;I mention these instances, that we may
be more cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, wherein
the court and jury may with so much ease be imposed upon, without
great care and <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>vigilance; the heinousness of the offence many times
transporting the judge and jury with so much indignation, that
they are over-hastily carried to the conviction of the person
accused thereof, by the confident testimony of sometimes false
and malicious witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am led to the adoption of these observations of the learned
Judge, by a perusal of the evidence given at the Old Bailey on
the trial of Hepburn and White, before mentioned.&mdash;With
respect to the abominable practices which several others were
convicted of, there can be no doubt but that Hepburn and White
participated in the extent of their guilt; but I am by no means
satisfied with the proof of the <i>capital part</i> for which
they suffered, upon the evidence of James Mann, a Drummer, who
himself was a <i>particeps crimines</i>: the notoriety of these
wretches&rsquo; propensities in many other instances, perhaps,
paved the way for the more ready admission of the witnesses
testimony; but if that evidence had been stripped of the <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>auxiliary
accusations, it would most certainly have been received with a
doubt sufficiently cogent to have acquitted them:&mdash;there are
some inconsistencies in the evidence, and some cause for
malignant motives in giving it; however, I have merely observed
upon this case that no degree of abhorrence attached to the crime
ought to interfere with the cool judgment of a jury;&mdash;who, I
dare say, were satisfied with their verdict: but we have had so
many instances of capital punishments resulting from
uncontrolable indignation, created by the heinousness of
offences, that in my mind the conviction of men charged with
atrocious crimes, does not always arise from the inevitable
proofs of their guilt.&nbsp; In this place it may be necessary to
make a few observations upon the cases of several persons who
have suffered death, transportation, and other punishments, upon
accusations of extorting, or attempting to extort, money, under a
threat of accusing the parties of Sodomitical practices; and as
some have suffered death <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>within these few years, upon
convictions of this nature, I enquired of Cook, if he knew, or
ever heard of any attack of that kind having been made upon
innocent men? when he informed me, that the prosecutors he had
heard of, so far from being innocent men, were all notorious
Sodomites, of the worst description; and that he has known many
instances of men being convicted for attempting to extort money
under such threats, where the prosecutor has allowed the party an
income sufficient to indulge them with every comfort during their
confinement:&mdash;that one man is now in Newgate, who was
sentenced to two years imprisonment, whose prosecutor regularly
paid him a Guinea per week during the whole time! for it seems
these wretches care not what it costs to convict, as, in their
idea, it clears their character.</p>
<p>I have a letter now before me, from a miserable creature in
Newgate, sentenced to transportation, whose story is briefly
this:&mdash;</p>
<p>A gentleman, with whom he lived servant, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>discharged
him without paying him his wages; upon which he wrote to his
master, saying that if he did not pay him, he would go to
Marlborough-street, the next day, and state his Sodomitical
practices; upon which, the gentleman went himself to the office,
and obtained a warrant, under the pretext of the man having
threatened to charge him with Sodomy unless he gave him
money:&mdash;he found means to convict the poor fellow, who had
two witnesses, who would have proved the truth of his assertion;
but they were kept out of the way by the master until the trial
was over:&mdash;one of whom has since been with him in Newgate,
and told him his master gave him <i>five pounds to keep out of
the way</i>!</p>
<p>A variety of similar convictions have taken place; for these
fashionable miscreants must wipe off the imputation, no matter by
what means.&nbsp; In fine, it seems to have come to this, <i>that
if a young man will not submit to Sodomy and hold his tongue</i>,
<i>he must be hanged</i>.</p>
<p>I will now relate some remarkable instances <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that have
come to my knowledge, some of them professionally.&nbsp; About
thirty years ago, a handsome young man, named Donelly, an
attorney&rsquo;s clerk, was cursed with the importunities of the
son of a noble earl, and from whom he received several sums of
money; but his demands became too rapid for this sprig of
nobility, who, from incapacity to answer them, was obliged to
desist.&nbsp; Donelly, one evening, in Berkeley-square, met the
elder brother, then Lord &mdash;, and mistaking him (from the
great likeness) for his little paramour, addressed him in terms
that induced the young nobleman to seize him, and take him before
a magistrate:&mdash;he was capitally convicted, and ordered for
execution.&nbsp; Under all these circumstances, he wrote to the
noble Earl, the father, who instituted an inquiry into his
son&rsquo;s conduct; which caused the Earl immediately to apply
to his Majesty for a free pardon for Donelly, which the Ordinary
of Newgate communicated to him in the <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>chapel, the Sunday previous to his
intended execution.</p>
<p>Another case, something similar, occurred about the year
1781.&nbsp; The late Felix Macarty, of no slender notoriety, was
attacked by the son of a noble Lord of the County of Surrey, on
the staircase leading to the great room at the Royal
Academy.&nbsp; Macarty, Irishman-like, did not much approve of
any caresses connected with breeches; and was no way solicitous
of keeping the affair secret: of course, the transaction made
some noise.&nbsp; The prejudice against an Irish adventurer, as
Macarty was termed, gave the transaction an interpretation that
conveyed an idea that his intention was to extort money from the
nobleman: however, a serious investigation took place with the
father and neighbouring gentlemen, of whom Sir Francis Vincent of
Stoke was one; when the young gentleman confessed the truth of
Macarty&rsquo;s charge, and was thereupon sent
abroad;&mdash;Macarty had five hundred guineas given him, as a
remuneration for what he <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>suffered in his character.&nbsp; I
had the particulars of this case from Sir Francis Vincent, who
was, at that time, my client.</p>
<p>But I will close the gainful subject of enormous convictions,
calculated to screen Sodomites, with a case fabricated only by
the premier fiend of hell.</p>
<p>It is somewhat about the same period, that I was with Sir
William Aldington, at Bow-street, about some business; when a
gentleman of great worth (if such a wretch can be said to have
any worth) was brought into the office by a soldier, named Cope,
and changed with attacking him, with an intent to commit an
unnatural crime.&nbsp; He stated, that the preceding evening,
about half past eleven o&rsquo;clock, he was stationed in the
Park, under the wall of Marlborough-gardens; when this gentleman
came up to him, and after some conversation, attempted to put his
hand in his breeches; he thereupon seized him, pushed him into
his box, and kept him there till the relief guard
came;&mdash;that the gentleman did every thing he <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>could to
persuade him to let him go; he offered him his watch, and purse,
containing seven or eight guineas, which he refused, and marched
him down to the guard-room.&nbsp; This was the charge; now,
intelligent reader, mark the defence!</p>
<p>On the magistrate&rsquo;s asking the gentleman (who, to the
disgrace of the profession, was an eminent Conveyancer) what
could bring him into the Park at that hour, and in the most
inclement evening that was ever felt?&mdash;he answered, that he
was obliged to go to Buckingham-house to see a lady, from whom he
wanted some information respecting the subject of a letter he was
writing, and which he could not finish until he had procured
it.</p>
<p>Sir William Addington,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not have been admitted into Buckingham-house
at that time of night, especially for the purpose of visiting a
lady!&mdash;have you that letter about! you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which he replied he had only just begun it.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Sir
William Addington.&mdash;&ldquo;Then, Sir, send for it in the
state you left it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was, &lsquo;I do not recollect where I put
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir W. A.&mdash;&ldquo;But after you had quitted
Buckingham-house, admitting you had been there, how came you in
that part of the Park where this soldier was
stationed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I intended to have gone through the stable yard, but
having missed it, I thought of going out at the
Priory-gate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir W. A.&mdash;&ldquo;Then why did you <i>not</i> go out
there? for this soldier&rsquo;s box was considerably beyond that
place!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Here a respectable gentleman of the profession came in, and
very judiciously put an end to the examination, by entering into
a recognizance for his client&rsquo;s appearance: to whom the
magistrate observed, he never heard so clear a case of guilt,
even from the defendant&rsquo;s own account.</p>
<p>Previous to the ensuing Westminster sessions Cope was sent on
the Windsor duty; whether <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>by collusion, or by the common
routine of duty never transpired, further than strong suspicion
upon the case.&nbsp; However, from either Cause, Cope, if he had
possessed the ability of following up his charge by an
indictment, had no opportunity; and, of course, <i>there</i> the
matter of complaint ended.&nbsp; But the dreadful wretch, not
content with his good fortune in escaping the Pillory, in order
to cleanse his pestiferous character, indicted Cope for falsely,
maliciously, and diabolically charging him with an attempt to
commit an unnatural crime.&mdash;Thunderstruck, when I heard of
the audacious attempt to legalize such an atrocious offence, I
went, in company with Mr. Bond, to hear the trial, if a trial it
could be called:&mdash;but, to get rid of the odious and painful
relation, it is only necessary to add, the poor ill-fated fellow
was convicted, upon the testimony of the vile old Sodomite; and,
if my memory is correct, the sentence of the Court was, that he
should be confined in Tothill-fields Bridewell for five years,
and stand in the Pillory once every year <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>during that
time.&nbsp; I may not be correct as to the number of times he
stood in the Pillory, but I know it was more than once.</p>
<p>When this phenomenon of a trial was ended, Mr. Bond, the
magistrate, and myself walked out of the court together, who
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;what do you think of this
conviction?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which I answered, I think as you do,
that the jury ought to be taken out of the box, and hanged at the
hall door.&nbsp; However, what can be said? but, alas, poor human
nature! judges are but men, and juries subject to
fallability!&nbsp; It may be supposed, that the prosecutor
received every assistance that could be had: the late Mr.
Bearcroft appeared, to give him a character: a character for
what?&mdash;why, that he paid his debts, and that he would not
pick a pocket; <i>and that he was never accused of committing a
rape</i>! which seems to be the amount of character in every
case, where a wretch is either prosecutor or defendant on similar
occasions.&nbsp; However, we will now come to the touch-stone,
which will, in a great measure, <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>decide the purity of this old
lecher&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; It seems the horrid sacrifice
made to purify his reputation, was not, in the opinion of
sensible and discerning men, perfectly satisfactory, whether his
penchant for breeches was not paramount to his affection for
petticoats?&nbsp; And even Mr. Bearcroft was not without a
slender portion of scepticism on the subject: for he remarked, in
a company where some doubts were entertained which of the two
ought to have been put in the pillory, Cope, or his prosecutor,
&ldquo;<i>D&mdash;n the fellow</i>! <i>now I think of it</i>,
<i>I never remember his having a girl at
college</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;But, to put all doubts at rest,
respecting this diabolical wretches&rsquo; guilt, it is only
necessary to state, that he retired into the country, and
attacked a farmer&rsquo;s son; who seized, and took him before a
magistrate, when he gave bail: but, foreseeing that he had a man
to deal with who was under no military command, nor subject to
any impediment for want of money, and too inflexible for any
chance of being diverted from his steady purpose of prosecution,
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>be wisely
withdrew himself from England&mdash;to which place he has never
returned.</p>
<p>I shall now conclude my observations on these hedious
transactions with a relation of the unexampled oppression that
Cook and his wife have been the objects of.&nbsp; With respect to
his wife, she could not have participated in any transactions of
her husband; she did not live in the odious house, or even visit
it; and, therefore, her sufferings are not warranted by any
plea:&mdash;and, indeed, whatever the man&rsquo;s offences might
be, he has most amply purged himself from all the criminal
effects of it; and is surely entitled to the protection of the
same law to guard his innocence, that was exerted to punish his
offence.&nbsp; That I may be clearly understood in what I deem
<i>acts of oppression</i>, I must state the ground that gave
pretence to the proceedings against him.</p>
<p>The reader will recollect that Cook had been desirous of
making a disclosure of the transactions for which he, and the
others were convicted, with the names and rank in life of a <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>great number
of persons implicated; not only at his own house, but at many
others, both private and public, the common depots of organized
Sodomites; and having been defeated of this intention at the
Secretary of State&rsquo;s office, published the following
Prospectus, in the form of a handbill, and distributed them among
his customers, both noble and ignoble.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Handbill</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preparing for the Press, and speedily will be
published,</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exhibition of the gambols practised by the ancient
lechers of Sodom and Gomorrah; embellished and improved with the
modern refinements in Sodomitical practices, by the Members of
the Vere-street Coterie of detestable memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The facts in this publication are given and
substantiated on oath, without regard to the rank or situation in
life of the several actors in this diabolical drama.&nbsp; Peers,
Footmen, and Foot-soldiers, will be held up to the indignation of
mankind (aye and womankind <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to) in the several characters they
acted, the hediousness of whose transactions petrify the
reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Cook, the author of this pamphlet, with shame,
confesses that he was an eye and ear witness to the execrable
scenes of iniquity he relates, and, but for the damning proofs
that put to confusion every attempt at contradiction, he would
despair of gaining credit for an hundredth part of the odious
tale he has to unfold.&nbsp; He is now in Newgate, undergoing a
punishment for keeping the rendezvous of the miscreants; a
punishment which ought, in strict justice, to have fallen to the
lot of the characters whose infamy will shortly come under the
cognizance of the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N.B.&nbsp; It is said that the ghost of White, the
drummer boy, lately executed for Sodomy, pays his nocturnal
visits to old Moggy, the rump-rider, Park-street, exclaiming,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster! amidst the din of infernal howl<br />
The fiends in hell will scramble for thy soul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>The
foregoing intimation caused some temporary abatement <i>of
whiskered dalliance</i>; and the softer passions gave way to the
spirit of revenge: the first fruits of which was a detainer for
twenty-three pounds debt, lodged against him on the eve of his
enlargement, after two year&rsquo;s imprisonment, of which he had
received a week&rsquo;s notice:&mdash;the attorney who issued out
the writ was applied to, and requested to give it to a
Sheriff&rsquo;s officer, to whom a sufficient bail-bond should be
given, although the defendant denied owing the money.&nbsp; Such
of my readers as are acquainted with the rules of practice will
conclude with me, that the ends of justice, and the completion of
an attorney&rsquo;s duty would have been answered by this means;
or, at least, any attorney who had not been <i>nursed by a
Siberian Tartar</i>, would have thought himself justified by
acceding to the proposition; but it was made to a wretch,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;whose
parent was a rock,<br />
And fierce Hercanean tigers gave him birth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I see by the roll of attorneys, that <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>the gentleman
in question stands alone; and that Providence seems satisfied
with the mischief done, by placing him there
<i>solo</i>!&mdash;In my anxiety to procure food for my next
number of legalized cormorancy, I made some inquiry respecting
the general practice of this virtuous one, <i>et
cetera</i>:&mdash;the answer I received from one professional
gentleman was as satisfactory as laconic: &ldquo;Did you ever see
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied in the negative:&mdash;then, said he,
&ldquo;his heart is as ugly as his face; <i>and that is as ugly
as Kit Chrishop&rsquo;s</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cook&rsquo;s brother, a poor hard-working man, happened to
have about forty pounds in his possession, a sum devoted to pay
for some timber, to carry on his business as a bedstead-maker;
and who, under the agonizing affliction of a brother in such a
predicament, in order to facilitate his enlargement, deposited
the amount of the debt, and ten pounds costs, in the
Sheriff&rsquo;s office, until the return of the writ, when it was
intended to justify bail, and try the cause.&nbsp; I will now
account for Cook&rsquo;s <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>being defeated in a remedy provided
even by an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>Being at liberty, and without a shilling to help himself, he
had recourse to several wretches who, in the burning frenzy of
their love fits, and to gratify the appetites of their
languishing enamoratas, ordered suppers, and run into other
expences for which they were not provided with the means of
prompt payment, and which they never thought fit to discharge
during his two year&rsquo;s confinement: he, therefore, called
upon some few of his <i>equivocal gender customers</i>, to remind
them that the dues arising out of their gallantries had not been
discharged.&nbsp; This led him, in company with his wife, to the
house of a Mr. Stewart, to enquire after his friend and neighbour
Mr. &mdash;, a ci-divant Reverend, who, it seems, had been
<i>unfrocked</i> during his probation in Newgate.&nbsp; Upon
Cook&rsquo;s name being announced, the old hen began clucking,
and caused a momentary cessation of amorous billing with the
salacious brood within.&nbsp; Cook, <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>not being able to get any
satisfaction, walked away; but was followed by a champion for the
sacred rights of Sodom, who, at the distance of two streets, came
up to them, seized the woman by the arm, and, after twisting her
round, knocked her down!&mdash;My reader will be apt to think
that this was beginning at the wrong end of a manly contest; but
it must be remembered that the woman was the most offensive
object of the two; for Cook, having breeches on, possessed the
<i>possibility</i> of a reconciliation; but with a petticoat, no
terms of accommodation could take place: and in this case the
antipathy was widened; for Mrs. Cook is really a good-looking,
nay, a pretty woman.&nbsp; However J. Shenston, whether John or
Jane I know not, received from Cook a knock-down blow in (his)
turn; with the token of which clinging to his nose and month he
ran back to Moggy Stewart&rsquo;s; and, after a fainting fit or
two had been recovered, Shenston assumed his male character, and
posted away to Marlborough-street; where, upon the <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>usual terms,
he obtained a warrant against both Cook and his wife, for a
pretended assault committed upon him.</p>
<p>Reader! as the business becomes a little more serious, I must
crave a little unprejudiced attention.&nbsp; The warrant being
executed in the evening, I undertook to produce the parties next
morning, before the magistrates; they, of course, willingly
appeared; when the hardy villain related the particulars of the
assault committed upon him, as if he had never heard of the crime
of perjury, or the punishment annexed to it: however the two
defendants were of course ordered to find bail, which they
did.&nbsp; And now begins a scene of oppression sufficient to
make a man believe that the actors were impatient for their share
of pillories and gibbets.&nbsp; When these two ill-fated people
were before the magistrates, Mr. Baker asked Shenstone what he
was?&mdash;he replied, a gentleman&rsquo;s servant out of
place.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you get your living?&rdquo; was the
next question. &lsquo;I am supported by my friends at
Birmingham:&rsquo; Cook, <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>not chusing to let this
<i>Birmingham-story</i>, pass, gave his <i>town-made</i>
description in the following workman-like manner; &ldquo;<i>You
are maintained by a set of Sodomites</i>! <i>these are your
friends that support you</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Now, mark how this
business was reported in the public papers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cook, the cidevant keeper of the Swan, in Vere-street,
was brought before the magistrates, for assaulting a respectable
tradesman, with an intent to extort money from him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The account then stated the names and places of residence of his
bail; and that Cook had been taken to Queen-square, a few days
before, for a similar attempt on a gentleman.&nbsp; With regard
to what passed at Marlborough-street, I have faithfully stated
it; and what passed at Queen-square was simply this, for I was
present.&nbsp; Cook met a gentleman of some consequence over
Westminster-bridge, and used some unpleasing language to him,
which raised a mob: he thereupon threatened to take Cook before a
magistrate, who replied that he <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>would meet him at Queen-square; where
they met, and, upon Cook&rsquo;s promising not to molest him
again, he was discharged.&nbsp; The reporter, not satisfied with
the most shameful perversion of truth, added a malignant,
diabolical note, that <i>extorting money is a capital
offence</i>.</p>
<p>I must now bestow a few observations upon the transactions at
Marlborough-street: and, first, with respect to the extortion and
respectability of the prosecutor, who, by his own account, is a
gentleman&rsquo;s servant out of place&mdash;no very promising
subject for extortion; a fellow whom Cook states to be one of the
lowest attendants at Vere-street, for the most depraved
purposes;&mdash;a fellow that was obliged to borrow a great coat
to appear before the magistrates!!!&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Extortion</span>! from a wretch living in a back
garret, and literally in rags, and whose breeches, from the
superfluous apertures, gave manifestation of rapturous attacks
upon his virtue! and whose finances were so far from satisfying
the demands of <i>extortion</i>, that the Constable was obliged
to go to one of <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>his Birmingham friends, for money to defray the trifling
expences at the office.</p>
<p>I have only to observe, on the conduct of the reporter, that
there can be no act of diabolism equal to the mischief
originating in the ignorance, falshood, or that species of low
bribed calumny, that is to be procured from the necessities of a
fellow, who would libel the fairest character in the nation, for
a beef-steak and pot of porter: and it is astonishing, that
magistrates will suffer such vermin to infest the
office:&mdash;at best, these hireling reporters are not to be
depended upon; and the experience of half a century enables me to
aver that I do not remember half a score correct reports, even of
what passed in the courts at Westminster.&nbsp; Nor does the
mischief close here: for the supplementary part of the atrocity
is equally dreadful; which consists in the conductors of the
Papers almost constantly refusing to correct their own errors, or
censuring the conduct of such pernicious scribblers.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>The
consequence attending the statement of which I am complaining has
been incalculable&mdash;for Cook&rsquo;s poor brother, who is a
man of unblemished character, is totally ruined&mdash;no one will
employ him.&nbsp; Degraded in the estimation of his neighbours,
his few creditors came upon him; his landlord gave him warning to
quit his house.&nbsp; Such have been the effects of a poison,
disseminated in a manner that has admitted of no antidote.&nbsp;
A similar fate, also, attended the other bail:&mdash;Mrs. Cook
turned out of her lodging at an hour&rsquo;s notice, and her
necessaries stopped until she had paid rent for a certain time
she could not inhabit.</p>
<p>I think I shall be pardoned if I pause for a moment, and ask
the candid and liberal reader whether the Reporter of such
unprincipled and profligate falshoods is not entitled to some,
and what reward?&nbsp; Slitting his nose! cutting off his
ears&mdash;or, exalting him to a situation, where he may receive
the kindred filth of his own pestiferous principles.&nbsp; I am a
friend to the liberty of the press in its fullest extent; <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>and have
given many convincing proofs of it: but I am not so incorrigible
an offender against the law of libels, as to deny my title to a
gibbet, had I been the author of so vile, so miscreantic, and so
reptilized a calumny!</p>
<p>The reader will recollect that Cook had deposited the money he
was detained for, under what I call a stupid, useless Act of
Parliament, calculated for no possible convenience for a
defendant; who could, without the aid of this idiotic act, always
deposit the debt and costs with a Sheriff&rsquo;s-officer until
he gave a bail-bond: but, under this Act, the debt is directed to
be paid into Court, with ten pounds costs; and when the defendant
has justified bail, he must be at the expence of a motion, to get
the money restored: but here, this miserable defendant was denied
the benefit of that Act, or, indeed, any existing law
whatever.&nbsp; But it is some consolation to say, that he is the
only man in the kingdom that is to be told, that neither law,
justice, or humanity dare approach him:&mdash;for he has been
denied the right <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>of submitting his case to a Jury, whether he owed the
money or not.&nbsp; The ten pounds costs having been deposited
with the debt, the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney has laid his hands
upon the whole, and the cause ended by a legalized robbery: for
the infamous statement in the newspaper, before mentioned, has
shut out the possibility of bailing the action and trying it.</p>
<p>Nor can the reptilized attorney, Wooley, who robbed them under
pretext of defending them, as stated in the beginning of this
treatise hope for a protraction of his iniquities longer than the
ensuing term, when I shall apply to the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench, to appoint Cook an Attorney; and I beg the candid reader
will believe, when I assert that I have used great economy in the
expenditure of the vast sum of Wooley&rsquo;s iniquity, which the
premier fiend of hell would tremble to count over: but perhaps
the hour is at no great distance, when I shall be more profuse in
the description of these person&rsquo;s sufferings, and
oppression; when I undertake the task of identifying the men with
the crimes, and the crimes with the men.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>In
fine, the poor beggared brother has lost the money, without a
possibility of a remedy: and, as a proof that Cook, wretched as
his situation is at this day, was not, and is not, without the
good opinion of many respectable men, an eminent tradesman, as
any in the city of Westminster, offered to indemnify bail to any
amount for him, or bail him, if he could do it without becoming
subject to Newspaper calumny.</p>
<p>Immediately after bailing the assault, Cook was arrested the
second time, and taken to a lock-up house (for the same malignant
fate pursued him, to the exclusion of all possibility of bailing
him) where he remained until a habeas could be sued out; upon
which he was taken to the Fleet-prison, destitute of the means of
procuring a supper or a bed, and subject to the ruffianly insults
of the unfeeling and uniformed part of the prisoners.&mdash;About
three days after he was committed to the Fleet, the Sessions, for
Middlesex commenced, when he and his wife were both indicted for
the pretended assault.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Cook
being in the Fleet, I procured bail for the wife only; O say
<i>procured</i>&mdash;for, during forty years&rsquo; practice I
never before, in any one instance, hired bail: and, upon her
being liberated, the magistrate, of course, granted a supersedeas
to the warrant.&nbsp; Yet, astonishing as it may appear, at least
to every professional man, this ill-fated woman was seized on the
Saturday-night following, as she was going into the Fleet to her
husband, by a ruffianly fellow named Creswell, a city constable;
and a companion, disdaining to be behind-hand with his master in
brutality; who took her to the Poultry Compter, where she was
kept until Monday in the most shocking of all situations, among
felons and prostitutes of the most abandoned description.</p>
<p>That those who were <i>paid</i> for this outrage should not
regard the supersedeas does not astonish me; but that the keeper
of the compter should set a legal instrument at defiance, that
strictly forbade him to molest or imprison the defendant, I do
confess, staggers every <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>conjecture I have been able to make
upon the subject:&mdash;I hope his conduct proceeded from sheer
ignorance, and I have some reason to think it did.&nbsp; However,
determined not to desert these unhappy people in any extremity, I
attended the Alderman at Guildhall, who very judiciously told
this Mr. Constable Creswell he could not take notice of any thing
but the supersedeas; and, of course, the woman was
discharged.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this determination of the
Alderman, this same Creswell took her into the County of
Middlesex and delivered her to a constable belonging to
Marlborough-street-office; and, after being wearied and tortured
for two or three hours more, she was again discharged.&nbsp; It
seems that at Marlborough-street (to use a trite phrase) the cat
jumped out of the bag! for there arose a violent contention
between Shenstone, the <i>nominal prosecutor</i>, and these
<i>upright</i>, <i>assiduous</i>, <i>ministers of justice</i>,
respecting, first, the amount of their wages, and, secondly, who
was so pay them?&mdash;which, I am <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>informed, ended in that species of
mutual satisfaction that thieves generally experience, in
<i>dividing the plunder of an empty purse</i>!</p>
<p>Another act of outrage was committed by this Creswell against
Cook and his wife, about a fortnight previous to the execution of
the warrant in question; when he apprehended, and took them to
the Compter, <i>without any warrant at all</i>! where they were
kept for the whole night.&nbsp; In the morning they went before
Sir Matthew Bloxam, with all the marks and bruises they had
received from Creswell over-night: but as the worthy Alderman
will, in all probability, be called upon in a court of Justice,
as a material witness, I shall add no more at present, than that
he acted like himself upon the occasion; and, thinking that Cook
had as much right <i>to his own watch</i> as Creswell, with a
severe reprimand compelled him to return it; <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a> at the same time we shall <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>see if
Creswell&rsquo;s indemnity for all these outrages will shelter
him from the wholesome scourge of criminal justice.</p>
<p>I hope and trust that there is not a lover of genuine liberty,
but will contribute a little to enable these oppressed people to
obtain impartial justice; not only against Constable Creswell,
but against <i>his employers</i>, whose abominations can have no
reliance upon impunity, but from the <i>destruction of
Cook</i>.&nbsp; And here I must repeat Lord Ellenborough&rsquo;s
assertion, that <i>although the parties may not be entitled to
respect</i>, <i>yet the laws must be respected</i>! therefore,
the same laws that punish crimes, must protect innocence; and I
hope brutal constable Creswell, and <i>rapacious lawyer
Woolley</i>, <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a> will <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>receive a lesson, that will inspire
them with some small portion of reverence for his
Lordship&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>The sufferings of Cook and his wife are marked with great
aggravation: for they are sacrificed, not as an atonement for
their own crimes, but that <i>the crimes of others shall not be
atoned for</i>! and for myself, I should not be surprised at any
act of desperation their wrongs may drive them to;&mdash;for,
when injustice is thought no crime, revenge becomes a virtue.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>ADDENDA.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">think</span> it necessary to give some
account of the debt of &pound;60 for which Cook is now confined
in the Fleet, at the suit of Mr. Henry Meux.</p>
<p>Cook had dealt with the house of Starkey and Jennings for many
years; who, soon after his conviction, seized upon all his
property, both at the Swan in Vere-street, and at the White
Horse, Long Acre; the latter being kept by his wife separately,
out of which she was forcibly turned; but, by what authority,
remains involved in mystery to this day.&nbsp; His dealings with
them appear to have been exemplary <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>correct and just, and such as by no
means could warrant the step they had taken;&mdash;there was no
money due for any beer, for that in the cellar was
over-paid:&mdash;the mortgage on the lease was reduced from
&pound;1175 to &pound;116; and there was no debt of any kind at
the time of the levy; for he did not owe ten shillings in the
world.</p>
<p>Among the property seized under this levy in Vere-street, were
six butts of porter, sent in by Mr. Henry Meux, the present
plaintiff against Cook.&nbsp; Some days after the levy, Mrs. Cook
learnt from the men in possession that all the effects were to be
sold:&mdash;she thereupon sent to Meux, to take his beer
back;&mdash;and to the Distiller, Mr. Temple: the latter of whom
succeeded in getting away his property.&nbsp; But Meux&rsquo;s
claim was resisted; and in a manner that would have induced me
(had Mr. Meux been my client) to have advised him to bring his
action, against Starkey and not Cook; for it must be observed,
this beer constituted the only debt due to Meux; whose cooper and
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>servants
will prove the struggle Cook made to have the beer returned: and
I have no doubt but a jury will remunerate him sufficiently, not
only to discharge Mr. Meux&rsquo;s demand, but to recompense him
for his imprisonment and other wrongs he has suffered from the
transactions of Starkey&rsquo;s house:&mdash;however, let my
suspicions on the subject be what they may, this is not a time to
promulgate them; as I shall reserve them for the contents of a
council&rsquo;s brief.&mdash;I have taken a vast deal of pains to
sift the conduct of this <i>brewing</i> community; and the end of
my research is, that no fault attaches to the <i>Draymen</i>, or
<i>horses</i>!&nbsp; Knavery, as well as Folly, <i>distinctly</i>
may accomplish much mischief; but a <i>combination</i> of both,
generally destroys the effect of each other;&mdash;which may,
perhaps, be illustrated in the present case.</p>
<p>The levy was made on the 18th July, 1810, the property all
taken, and Mrs. Cook turned into the street; and on the 26th of
September following, being a space of two months that <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Cook had
received no account of his property; but the evening of the day
previous to his standing in the pillory, he was visited by Mr.
Batt, the fac-totum of Starkey&rsquo;s Brewhouse, and some other
persons, to finally settle the accounts with the house.&nbsp; It
must be confessed it was an hour illy calculated to settle
accounts&mdash;more especially <i>such accounts</i>.&nbsp; Cook,
in the moment of distraction, expecting to meet a violent death
in a few hours, had neither time or spirits to expostulate; he
made no objection to any settlement; a cabbage-leaf would have
been as satisfactory to him <i>then</i> as the following
receipt.</p>
<blockquote><p>&pound;381 13<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: right">26th Sept. 1810,</p>
<p>Received of Mr. Cook the sum of three hundred and eighty-one
pounds 13s. 2d. being the balance of his account, and in full of
all demands up to this day, due to Mrs. Starkey.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">WILLIAM BATT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However Mr. Batt thought the account very satisfactorily
settled; and if Cook had been murdered the next day, it might
have remained <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>undisturbed; but, in my opinion, this receipt will prove
the fruitful mother of a monstrous progeny!&nbsp; It was a
cunning trick for a Brewer!&nbsp; It is a pity he was so scanty
of a <i>few grains</i> (I mean of common humanity and candor)
<i>but he is a</i> <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>!&mdash;As to
myself it is conduct inexplicable! but time may mature this
mis-shapen f&oelig;tus of a <i>mash-tub</i>; and it may live to
prove that the mutilated worm that is trod in the earth to day,
may rise a scorpion to-morrow, and sting its oppressor to the
heart.</p>
<p>After all, it is to be wished, for the sake of public, justice
and common humanity, that Mr. Meux would, for the present,
discharge a man from prison, of whose integrity and anxiety to do
him justice he has had such convincing proofs; and I am not
without a hope that he will do it, as I see by the writ his
Attorney is one of those few men who disdain making a bill of
costs out of the bowels of wretchedness.&nbsp; If Mr. Meux thinks
the man possessed means of paying for a dinner when he was <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>taken to a
sponging house, he has been criminally imposed upon: for, from
the moment he arrested him, to the present time, he has not had
the means of procuring a two-penny loaf, but from the most
mortifying mendicity.&nbsp; I do not wish to make any
observations upon the unprovoked conduct of arresting him, for I
firmly believe Mr. Meux is wholly ignorant of his wretched
situation.</p>
<p>After Cook&rsquo;s trial for the pretended assault, the public
will be favored with the names and residences of the parties who
are the principal objects of this publication; a great number of
whom will be compelled to attend in Court, to give evidence on
particular points connected with the trial.</p>
<p>I have only to add, in conclusion, that, as I begun with an
apology for writing these pages at all, I now feel an equal
inclination to apologize for having written them so ill, and so
unworthy the pen of any man laying the least claim to literary
abilities;&mdash;it has been an odious task; but my end is
answered if it procures <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the injured man and his wife that
justice I think them entitled to; and I hope the sale of it will
afford them some relief.</p>

<p>N.B.&nbsp; Cook intreats me to say, that during the twelve
years he was in business he dealt with the following persons,
exclusive of Starkey and Meux; whose justice he now challenges,
to say if his conduct has not been uniformly marked with
integrity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
